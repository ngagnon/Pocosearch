- Unit testing
    - PocosearchClient & IndexManager still have some logic in them (hard to test)
    - ExpressionResolver.ResolvePredicate
    - SearchQueryBuilder

- Integration tests
- Could we add caching to ExpressionResolver?
- Would probably need an equivalent to FullText for specifying aliases on non-full-text fields?
- Finish writing README
- NuGet
